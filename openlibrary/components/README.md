Files in the root of this directory are compiled and added to `/static/build/components/`.  These components can be rendered from template files like so:

```html
$:render_component('HelloWorld', attrs=dict(name="Jimmy"))
```

The building of these files happens on `make components`.

## Live-reloading dev server

First, update `openlibrary/components/dev.js` to use the component you're developing instead of `HelloWorld.vue`
Then, outside the docker environment, run: 

```shell script
npx vue-cli-service serve openlibrary/components/dev.js
```

## Caveats

- Currently does not support IE11 because it's using web components (See https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1 )
- Vue is currently included with each component, so rendering multiple components per page results in very large load sizes
- JSON attributes currently don't work
