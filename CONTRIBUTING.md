## Development

Whenever working on a new feature/hotfix/refactor, the first step is to make sure a corresponding issue exists. We then take this issue number and affix it to the branch name which we will use for development.

A branch name consists of the: issue number, whether it is a feature/hotfix/refactor, and a human readable slug, e.g:

```
123/refactor/simplifying-authentication-using-xauthn
```

With respect to client side patches, before submitting your patch you'll want to check it adheres to code styling rules and tests. We use `npm` to test our client side code.

```
npm install
npm test
```

If it passes your patch is ready for review!

Note, many issues can be fixed automatically without any manual work from your part using the following command:

```
npm run lint:fix
```

## Pull Requests

* Pull Requests (PRs) should link to the issue they resolve. Please take the time to check whether someone has already raised the issue you are solving. At the very least PRs should contain enough detail in the description to explain the purpose of the PR; what feature it adds, or problem it solves. Please expect PRs without sufficient details to be rejected until an clear description of the benefit is added. Thank you for your contributions!

* When your code is ready for review, please follow our [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to close the corresponding Issue.
