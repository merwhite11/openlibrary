## Development

Whenever working on a new feature/hotfix/refactor, the first step is to make sure a corresponding issue exists. We then take this issue number and affix it to the branch name which we will use for development.

A branch name consists of the: issue number, whether it is a feature/hotfix/refactor, and a human readable slug, e.g:

    123/refactor/simplifying-authentication-using-xauthn

## Pull Requests

* Pull Requests (PRs) must link to the issue they resolve. Please expect PRs without corresponding issues to be rejected until an issue is retroactively created and linked to it.

* When your code is ready for review, please follow our [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to close the corresponding issue.
