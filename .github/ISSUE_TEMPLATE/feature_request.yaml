        **Before making a new branch _or_ updating an existing one, please ensure your branch is up to date.**

        To do so, you can run:
        ```
        git switch master
        git pull --ff-only upstream master
        git push origin master
        ```
        If making a new branch, you can then run:
        ```
        git switch -c new-branch-name
        ```
        Or if returning to an existing branch:
        ```
        git switch existing-branch-name
        git rebase master
        ```
